                <p>These were questions that were going on in my

                    <p>
                        <li>Does it go straight to the jackpot?</li>
                        <li>How is the money divded?</li>
                        <li>Where is the money really going?</li>
                        <li>How can I get participants to read and interact 
                            with the information?</li>
                        <li>Who is most affected?</li>

                    <p>These questions allowed me to come up with sections because I as well am interested in these things when it comes to playing the lottery.</p>

                    <p>This project challenged my way of thinking when I was given the job of making both a print and interactive version of this informational project.</p> <p>I found the print piece being the most difficult due to it's size and shape.

                    <p>Some things I have learned from this experience is that the narrative is really important on how we gain attention from users/participants. Without it, information data becomes less interesting for many.</p>
                    <p>Also, I maybe should stop buying lottery tickets from now on.</p>
